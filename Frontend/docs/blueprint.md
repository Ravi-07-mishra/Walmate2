## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Walmart Blue (#0071CE) to align with the client brand. Its cultural association with dependability, trustworthiness, and value helps users feel comfortable engaging with the platform.
- Background color: Light desaturated blue (#E5F1F8), is closely aligned in hue with Walmart's signature blue but much more desaturated (at 25% saturation), yielding a bright but clean and simple background.
- Accent color: Vibrant purple (#71008F) for interactive elements like buttons and chat icons; analogous to blue, it adds a sense of creativity and modernity. A relatively high saturation of 55% sets it apart from the other colors.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, provides a clean, modern readability for headlines and body text.
- Consistent minimalist icons from Feather or Material Icons for a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Fade-in animations, hover effects on cards and buttons, and slide transitions for chat and product overlays.
- Fully responsive layout that works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile; the sidebar collapses into a hamburger drawer on mobile; the grid system adapts for different screen sizes.
